# PPG Analyzer (Legacy MATLAB GUI)

This project contains the legacy MATLAB software for photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal analysis.  
The software includes a GUI developed using MATLAB GUIDE, used to load, filter, and analyze PPG signals collected with an Arduino-based sensor.

## üß† Technologies

- MATLAB GUI (GUIDE)
- Signal processing:
  - Butterworth band-pass filter
  - Wavelet transform
- Data input from Arduino-based Pulse Sensor SEN-11574
- Supported formats: `.mat`, `.txt`

## üìÅ Folder Structure

- `programfiles/`: temporary variables and intermediate data  
- `processeddata/`: per-signal analysis results  
- `data/`: example legacy PPG signal recordings (see separate [README](data/README.md))

## üß™ Origin and Use

This project began as part of an internship at **ESIEE Paris** (2018), focusing on remote diagnostics using pulse sensors.  
It was later extended and used at the **Pavlov Institute of Physiology**, Russian Academy of Sciences.  
I was a co-author of the software; the rightsholder is the Pavlov Institute of Physiology.
